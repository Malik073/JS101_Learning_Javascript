You are given four numbers, stored in the variables with the following names

one, two, three, four

Perform the following operations on the four numbers

The value stored in one and two is doubled, such that, if it was 2 initially, it becomes 4
The value stored in three is multiplied by 3, such that, if it was 4, it becomes 12
The value stored in four, is increased by 4, such that if it was 7 initially, it becomes 11
Find the sum of the values stored inone, two, three, four, after the above operations are performed


let a= 1;
let b=2;
let c=3;
let d=4;
let e=5;
let f=6;
let g=7;


console.log((a+b+c) * (d+e+f+g));
//console.log((a*2) + (b*2) + (c*3) + (d+4));

//console.log((a+b) *2);
